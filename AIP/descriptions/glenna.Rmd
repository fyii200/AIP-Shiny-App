My PhD research focus was on spatial point process models in a Bayesian context. Since then, I have gained experience in modelling time to event data (in a Bayesian context), constructing R packages, analysing longitudinal data and spatiotemporal data, construction of complex survey weights, factor analysis and machine learning.   I possess broad skills covering both Bayesian and Frequentist statistical modelling, and have developed custom models that are perfectly suited to the task at hand rather than using off-the-shelf models.

I also collaborate with other Statisticians and Epidemiologistsâ€“ for example on projects that involve Area Interaction Point Process Models,  Log Gaussian Cox Processes,  time series modelling using ARIMA, HMM, and GLMs and COVID-19 surveillance.
